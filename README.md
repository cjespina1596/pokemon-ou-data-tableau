## What this project is about

  This project takes data from [Smogon](www.smogon.com), one of the largest competitive Pokemon communities, and visualizes said data to find trends in competitive battling for Generation 8 (Sword and Shield) OU from November 2019 to November 2022. With this, one can gain an insight on how their favorite Pokemon (or any specific one) performed in the metagame during those specific months. This project used Tableau Public to create the visualization and Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and organization. 
  
## What inspired the creation of this Project

  I have been playing Pokemon battles in [Pokemon Showdown](play.pokemonshowdown.com) since 2014 but has been on and off, with my playtime peaking shortly after Pokemon game releases. The recent release of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet rekindled my interest in competitive battling. Coinciding that with my desire to switch careers into the field of Data Analysis led me to create this project. I chose Generation 8 instead of the newly released Generation 9 due to the abundance of data over three years.
  
## Key Terms (for those unfamiliar with Pokemon and its competitive scene)

  1. Pokemon (games) - a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokemon Company under the Pokemon media franchise. The original games, _Pokemon Red and Green_ were released in 1996. Since then there have been nine total generation of mainline Pokemon games, with the latest being _Pokemon Scarlet and Violet_, released on November 18, 2022.
  2. Pokemon (creatures) - the creatures which are the main focus of the Pokemon games and media franchise. There are currently 1008 Pokemon, with Pikachu being the most popular as well as the mascot of the series.
  3. Competitive Battling - a form of Pokemon battles between players with set rules to ensure fairness between players, often done for prizes, fame or most commonly, fun.
  4. Pokemon Showdown - currently the most popular Pokemon battle simulator, which provides a way to initiate competitive battles without the need for training, catching or breeding new Pokemon.
  5. Smogon - a community of competitive Pokemon gamers, which manages the ruleset of battling under the Pokemon Showdown siumlator.
  6. OU - short for Overused, is the standard tier of competitive battling under Smogon's rules. In this tier, all Pokemon except those banned due to being too powerful are allowed to be played.
  
## Methodology

  1. I first downloaded the Pokemon usage data from Smogon's database (https://www.smogon.com/stats/). I got the text files named "gen8ou-1695.txt" for each month, the data that is used for OU Tiering.
  2. The raw data were then converted to a usable form for data analysis using Microsoft Excel and some macro functions.
  3. The data were compiled into a single Excel file to ease uploading to Tableau.
  4. I created another Excel spreadsheet for auxiliary data like Evolutionary stages and Legendary Status. The data were obtained from [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) and [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/index2.shtml).
  5. Using Tableau, I then created the visualization.
